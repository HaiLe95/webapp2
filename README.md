##Welcome to test web application

This is fast recreation of webapp I used to work with.

##What do you need to have:
 - Maven
 - MySQL
 
Anything else IDEA will do for ya. I hope so.

First things first create new schema in your localhost dump and name it as "webapp[2]".
Im not sure if hibernate will automatically create this schema for you. Just warning.

Utilities are still in progress.
All commentaries are still in progress.


Thanks. Have fun!
